\textbf{HandTyper - Real-Time Gesture Recognition System} \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a real-time gesture recognition system (Python/OpenCV) to translate BSL into PC inputs. This 
  project focused on Human-Computer Interaction, exploring how users can engage with
   digital interfaces beyond traditional methods—a perspective I apply to creating platform-native social content.
  \item The system utilized machine learning 
  algorithms to accurately interpret various hand gestures and British Sign Language (BSL), providing an 
  innovative solution 
  for accessibility and human-computer interaction.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{University Open Day Guides w/ NFC Tags} \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item To assist prospective students during the University Open Days whilst upholding the university's commitment to 
sustainability. I introduced a new interaction framework where staff members would have NFC tags linking towards
a digital guide for the University and the relevant event.
  \item This reduced the need for printed materials and 
allowed for easy access to information via smartphones whilst also providing a modern and interactive experience for visitors.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{University Events (Open Day + Outreach)} \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item I have also participated and assisted in the organisation, running and the marketing of various University and Faculty events including
Open Days and Outreach programs. During these events, I took on roles such as guiding
prospective students, providing information about courses and campus life,
and assisting with event logistics. 

  \item My involvement in these events has helped me develop strong communication
and interpersonal skills, as well as a deeper understanding of the university's offerings and student needs.
